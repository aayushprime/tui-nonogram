# Nonogram TUI
## How to play
Some cells in a grid are filled while others are empty. The goal is to fill in the grid based on the numbers provided for each row and column. These numbers indicate the lengths of consecutive filled cells in that row or column.

Mark the filled cells with the character 'o' and the empty cells with the character 'x'.

Finish the puzzle without making more than 3 mistakes!

Use `hjkl` (left, down, up, right) to move.
